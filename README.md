# Moving Forward - An ACEMS Working Group on Measuring Impact

To continue to progress this issue a Research Impact Working Group be established as an outcome of the workshop. The aim of the working group is to develop a white paper with proposal for how research impact could be implemented into the professional performance review and career trajectories of university research and other staff. 

Please get in touch with [Jessie Roberts](https://github.com/jesse-jesse) to be added to the working group email or express your interest in being invovled.
