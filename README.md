> "Curiosity is what drives me, but as a mathematicians I am one step removed from applications. But that's where the engineers and scientists come in!" [Chubb, 2014](https://github.com/ACEMS/measuring_impact_2018/wiki/Resources-&-Presenters-Slides)

This repo relates to the Measuring Impact in the Mathematical Sciences seminar hosted by [ACEMS](acems.org.au) on October 4th, 2018.

Please see the [Wiki](https://github.com/ACEMS/measuring_impact_2018/wiki) tab above for the workshop program, presenters slides and other interesting resources.

Please add ideas for potential tools to the [Issues](https://github.com/ACEMS/measuring_impact_2018/issues) section through the tab above. We will continue to explore these ideas. Further details will be posted here as collaborations and work progresses. 

This is an [ACEMS](www.acems.org.au) event, hosted by [Professor Adrian Barnett](https://github.com/agbarnett) and [Jessie Roberts](https://github.com/jesse-jesse)
